This is an extension of my idea at HackNC to provide information on GHG emissions for travel. It's also inspired by the EPA's 
gas economy calculator found here. https://www.fueleconomy.gov/trip/

I implemented representations of different vehicles using abstraction and inheritance,
and I controlled their instantiation through an abstract factory.

A simple class providing information for the trip encapsulates a vehicle instance
and calculates GHG emissions per passenger.

This is designed to encourage a reduction of GHG emissions by carpooling and choosing vehicles with good gas economy.

In the future, I will reference a database of vehicles to generate their MPGs and passenger capacities.

I will also integrate the Google Maps API to generate destination distances.
